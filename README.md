# Inter-process-Communication-IPC-
Project of IPC <br>
This project is basically build to understand the concept of Inter-process Communication. There are two ways by which machine communicate with each other without any data leakage, the two ways are: <br>
<br>
Message passing IPC<br>
Shared Memory IPC
<br>
These both are covered in this website by which you can learn both concepts easily using the simulations.
